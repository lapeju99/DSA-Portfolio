FROM [dbo].[KMS Sql Case Study]
WHERE Customer_Segment = 'Small Business'
GROUP BY Customer_Segment, Customer_Name
ORDER BY TotalSales desc


Question 8:

Which Corporate Customer placed the most number of orders in 2009 â€“ 2012?

SELECT TOP 1 Customer_Name, COUNT(DISTINCT Order_ID) AS Number_of_Orders
FROM [dbo].[KMS Sql Case Study]

Question 10:Which customer returned items, and what segment do they belong to?

SELECT DISTINCT TOP 10 o.[Order_ID], o.[Customer_Name], o.[Customer_Segment]
FROM [dbo].[KMS Sql Case Study] o
JOIN [dbo].[OrderStatus] r 
ON o.[Order_ID] = r.[Order_ID]
WHERE r.Status = 'Returned';

11. If the delivery truck is the most economical but the slowest shipping method and 
Express Air is the fastest but the most expensive one, do you think the company 
appropriately spent shipping costs based on the Order Priority? Explain your answer

SELECT [Order_Priority], [Ship_Mode],
COUNT([Order_ID]) AS OrderCount,
ROUND(SUM(Sales - Profit), 2) AS EstimatedShippingCost,
AVG(DATEDIFF(day, [Order_Date], [Ship_Date])) AS AvgShipDays
FROM [dbo].[KMS Sql Case Study]
GROUP BY [Order_Priority], [Ship_Mode]
ORDER BY [Order_Priority], [Ship_Mode] DESC;

Idon't think the company spent apprioipriately because customers take proirity very important and could impact their next buy.
