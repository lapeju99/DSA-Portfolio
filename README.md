SELECT TOP 1 Customer_Name, COUNT(DISTINCT Order_ID) AS Number_of_Orders
FROM [dbo].[KMS Sql Case Study]

SELECT DISTINCT TOP 10 o.[Order_ID], o.[Customer_Name], o.[Customer_Segment]
FROM [dbo].[KMS Sql Case Study] o
JOIN [dbo].[OrderStatus] r 
ON o.[Order_ID] = r.[Order_ID]
WHERE r.Status = 'Returned';

## Question 11:
If the delivery truck is the most economical but the slowest shipping method and 
Express Air is the fastest but the most expensive one, do you think the company 
appropriately spent shipping costs based on the Order Priority? Explain your answer

SELECT [Order_Priority], [Ship_Mode],
COUNT([Order_ID]) AS OrderCount,
ROUND(SUM(Sales - Profit), 2) AS EstimatedShippingCost,
AVG(DATEDIFF(day, [Order_Date], [Ship_Date])) AS AvgShipDays
FROM [dbo].[KMS Sql Case Study]
GROUP BY [Order_Priority], [Ship_Mode]
ORDER BY [Order_Priority], [Ship_Mode] DESC;

### I don't think the company spent apprioipriately because customers take proirity very important and could impact their next buy.

## Insights

### 1. Gender Distribution
Insight:
The organization shows a gender imbalance, with male employees significantly outnumbering female employees across all regions.

Region A had the highest gender skew, with over 70% male representation.

Female employees were most concentrated in departments like Admin and Customer Service, while departments like Engineering and Production were male-dominated.

A small percentage of employees did not disclose their gender. These were categorized as ‚ÄúUndisclosed‚Äù for analysis consistency.

Recommendation:
Targeted recruitment drives focused on increasing female participation, especially in technical departments.


###  2. Ratings by Gender
Insight:

Male employees were more frequently rated as "Good" and "Very Good", while female employees received a higher proportion of "Average" and "Poor" ratings.

The data suggests possible unconscious bias or unequal access to performance-improving opportunities.

Recommendation:
Audit the performance appraisal system and training access. Introduce anonymous peer reviews and manager calibration sessions.


###  3. Gender Pay Gap Analysis
Insight:

A gender pay gap exists across multiple departments and regions.

Male employees earn higher average salaries than female counterparts in Engineering, Production, and Operations.

The gap is smallest in Admin and Customer Service, where female representation is higher.

Recommendation:
Conduct structured pay reviews and develop an equitable salary band system by job role, not gender. Transparency in promotion and pay decisions should be improved.


### 4. Salary Compliance & Pay Distribution
Insight:
The company is non-compliant with the new minimum wage regulation of $90,000:

34% of employees earn below the regulatory minimum, most of whom are in Region C and Support departments.

The salary distribution shows a concentration in the $60,000 ‚Äì $80,000 range, with fewer employees in the top band.

Recommendation:
Immediate salary reviews for affected employees. Adjust salary structures to meet compliance, especially in vulnerable departments.

Bonus Insight:

Salary band distribution visualization revealed potential compression issues, where high-performing staff were stuck in mid-tier salary bands.


### 5. Bonus Allocation Based on Performance
Insight:

Annual bonus allocations were computed using department-specific bonus percentages based on employee performance ratings.

The total bonus paid across the company was approximately $68.04bn.

Employees rated as "Very Good" in departments like Sales and Engineering received the highest bonuses.

Top 3 Departments by Total Bonus Paid:

Engineering

Sales

Operations

Recommendation:
Use bonus allocation as a motivation strategy but monitor fairness. Ensure managers are not skewing ratings to manipulate bonus distribution.

### Total Compensation Analysis
Insight:

By combining base salary and bonus, a new view of Total Compensation was created.

Some employees who earned modest salaries benefited significantly from performance bonuses.

Region A had the highest average total compensation, while Region C lagged behind.

Recommendation:
Use Total Compensation as a retention metric and benchmark future compensation strategies.
